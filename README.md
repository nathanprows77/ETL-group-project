ETL Project discussing student academic performance and factors that may affect it.

For our project, we propose that we examine student academic performance in the K-12 public education system and its correlation with teacher salaries.
Our data sets include a .csv file included in a Kaggle dataset called Student Performance in Exams: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/student-performance-in-exams

8/29/2020 @ 1:27 PM: We are finding another data set that contains teacher salaries with overlapping performance indicators with the above data set.

# Considerations
- What correlations can we find between teacher salary and student test performance.
- How do the factors that affect teacher salary, such as area, average income in state, etc. affect the findings? Do they also affect student performance
